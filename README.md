🛍️ E-Commerce Application
📖 About the Project

The E-Commerce App is a complete online shopping solution built using React, NestJS, Node.js, and SQL, designed to make buying and selling products simple, fast, and efficient.
This full-stack project provides a seamless digital marketplace where users can explore products, add them to their cart, make secure payments, and track their orders — all in one place.

The frontend, developed with React, delivers a responsive and interactive user experience across all devices.
The backend, built on NestJS (powered by Node.js), ensures scalable API development, high performance, and secure data handling.
All transactional and user data is stored in a SQL database, maintaining reliability, accuracy, and consistency.

For administrators, the app includes a robust dashboard to manage products, categories, orders, and customers efficiently.
The system architecture emphasizes modularity, scalability, and maintainability, ensuring smooth management for both users and admins.

The main goal of this project is to demonstrate the core functionalities of a real-world e-commerce platform, including:

User authentication and authorization

Product and category management

Secure order placement and payment processing

Real-time order tracking

Administrative management and analytics

This project was developed as part of a learning process to gain hands-on experience in full-stack web development, API integration, and database management, while applying modern development practices and clean architectural design.
